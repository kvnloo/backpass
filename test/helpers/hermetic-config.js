/**
 * Loaded before every test file (`--import` in the package.json `test` script).
 *
 * Three things a test process must not share with the developer's machine:
 *
 * - The config home. `loadConfig` layers `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/backpass/config.json` under
 *   every run, so a developer's own personal config - custom ladders, hosts, a `user`
 *   block - would otherwise change what the suite asserts about defaults and agent
 *   selection. Each test process therefore starts from an empty config home of its own.
 *   Tests that need a config home still set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` themselves and restore
 *   this value after.
 * - The temp root. Tests create their fixtures with `fs.mkdtempSync(os.tmpdir())` and do
 *   not remove them, which left over a thousand directories behind per full run. Node's
 *   `os.tmpdir()` reads `TMPDIR` on every call, so pointing it at one per-process root
 *   (inherited by spawned CLI children) lets a single removal clean up everything.
 * - The harness homes. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CODEX_HOME` relocate where memory files,
 *   skills, and sessions are looked up. A coding agent that runs the suite usually has
 *   one of them set, which moved the defaults the suite asserts and failed tests that
 *   pass in a plain shell. Tests that cover relocation set the variable themselves.
